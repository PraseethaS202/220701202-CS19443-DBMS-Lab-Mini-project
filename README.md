# A Student Result Management System (SRMS) is a digital solution designed to streamline the process of recording, analyzing, and disseminating student academic performance data. It automates grade entry, calculates GPA, and generates comprehensive reports, enhancing accuracy and efficiency. By providing secure, centralized access to results, the SRMS facilitates communication between educators, students, and parents. It supports data-driven decision-making, identifies academic trends, and helps in early detection of students needing intervention.
